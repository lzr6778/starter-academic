  I'm a Ph.D. student in Kyoto University. My current research is analyzation of freak wave, which is a natural disaster caused by high-order nonlinearity in random wave train.
  I concentrated on Biology Olympiad in high school, and turned to Hydraulic Engineering in University. After that, I focus on the research about coastal and offshore engineering. I am interested in describing natural phenomenon in beautiful mathematical equations and numerical analysis.
