  I'm a reseacher in coastal disaster risk research lab in Kyoto university. My current research is freak waves in global wave modeling in climate change. 

  I concentrated on Biology Olympiad in high school, and turned to Hydraulic Engineering in University. After that, I focus on the research about coastal and offshore engineering. I am interested in describing natural phenomenon in beautiful mathematical equations and numerical analysis.
